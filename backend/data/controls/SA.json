This includes implementing privacy controls, minimizing data collection, and ensuring data protection measures are in place.\n\n2. Least Privilege: Limit access to system resources to only those necessary for users to perform their job functions. This principle helps reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.\n\n3. Defense-in-Depth: Implement multiple layers of security controls to protect systems and data. This includes network segmentation, encryption, intrusion detection systems, and regular security monitoring.\n\n4. Secure Development Practices: Follow secure coding practices and conduct regular security testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in software applications.\n\n5. Resilience and Redundancy: Design systems with resilience and redundancy in mind to ensure continuity of operations in the event of a cyber incident or disaster.\n\nBy incorporating these principles into the system development process, organizations can enhance the security and privacy posture of their systems and better protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure.",

Implement strict access controls and user permissions to limit the number of individuals who can make changes to the system.\n4. Conduct regular audits and monitoring of system logs to detect any unauthorized changes or tampering attempts.\n5.
