This involves utilizing a centralized system to authenticate and authorize users, devices, and entities within your organization. \n\nHere is an implementation plan for compliance:\n1. Identify the identity providers and authorization servers that are suitable for your organization's needs.\n2. Integrate these systems with your existing infrastructure to ensure seamless authentication and authorization processes.\n3. Configure the identity providers and authorization servers to enforce access controls based on user roles, attributes, and policies.\n4. Regularly review and update the configurations to ensure they align with your organization's security requirements and compliance standards.\n5. Train your employees on how to use the identity providers and authorization servers effectively to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n6. Conduct regular audits and assessments to verify that the identity providers and authorization servers are functioning as intended and are compliant with relevant regulations.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively implement identity providers and authorization servers to meet the requirements of control IA-13.",
