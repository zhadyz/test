Develop a data classification policy that clearly defines how information should be categorized and fragmented.\n3. Implement access controls to restrict access to sensitive information based on the principle of least privilege.\n4. Train employees on the importance of information fragmentation and the proper handling of sensitive information.\n5. Regularly review and update the data classification policy to ensure it remains effective and relevant.\n6. Conduct periodic audits to verify compliance with the information fragmentation policy.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that sensitive information is appropriately fragmented and protected within your organization to comply with the Information Fragmentation control (si-23).",
