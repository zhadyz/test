AI can assist with vulnerability assessment using electromagnetic simulation modeling, optimization of shielding design for cost-effectiveness, and continuous monitoring of shielding integrity. Implement graded shielding approach: hardened facilities use welded steel enclosures meeting MIL-STD-188-125, operational equipment in nested shielded enclosures, and non-hardened backup systems in dispersed locations. Consider HEMP (High-altitude EMP) filters on all penetrations, surge protection on power and communications, and fiber optic external communications. Testing using MIL-STD-461G methods validates shielding effectiveness. For less critical systems, consider insurance-based risk transfer rather than hardening."
