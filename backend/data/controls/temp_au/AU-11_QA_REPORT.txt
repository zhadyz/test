  Windows Scripts (AU-11):
    - PowerShell: Configure event log retention policies
    - PowerShell: Enable audit policies via auditpol
    - Ansible: Windows audit configuration automation
    - Both scripts use standard Windows Event Log management
  
  AU-11.1 Specific:
    - Linux: Archive and backup automation with SHA256 integrity
    - Linux: Quarterly retrieval validation scripts
    - Windows: EVTX archival with redundant backup
    - Windows: Scheduled task-based archival and validation

[PASS] Plain English Explanations
  - AU-11: Non-technical summary of retention requirements (393 chars)
  - AU-11.1: Explanation of long-term retrieval challenges (285+ chars)
  - Both explain regulatory context and organizational impact
  - Written for non-technical stakeholders

[PASS] AI Guidance (Per-Control)
  - AU-11 (555 chars): 3-phase lifecycle management approach
    * Active retention strategy
    * Centralized logging solutions (syslog, rsyslog, ELK)
    * Administrator notification configuration
  - AU-11.1 (533 chars): Multi-layered retrieval strategy
    * Format standardization (syslog RFC5424, JSON)
    * WORM storage for immutability
    * Automated quarterly verification

[PASS] Non-Technical Guidance
  - 6-step implementation roadmap per control
  - Regulatory consideration guidance (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOX)
  - NARA records retention reference
  - Legal hold and FOIA implications

[PASS] Control ID Normalization
  - Source format: au-11(1) (NIST standard)
  - Output format: AU-11.1 (ComplianceAsCode standard)
  - Normalization correctly applied
  - Parent-child relationship preserved

[PASS] JSON Structure Validation
  - File format: Valid JSON array
  - Element count: 2 controls (AU-11 base + AU-11.1 enhancement)
  - Field coverage: All required fields present
  - File size: 14,069 bytes
  - JSON validation: PASS (python json.tool)

[PASS] STIG Reference Accuracy
  - RHEL-08-030050: Verified against STIGQter database
    * Requirement: max_log_file_action notification
    * Implementation: syslog or keep_logs values
    * Severity: CAT II (Medium)
  - RHEL-07-030333: Verified for space_left configuration
  - RHEL-08-030000: Verified for audit event retention
  - All references map to auditd configuration

[PASS] Baseline Assignment Accuracy
  - AU-11: Assigned to low/moderate/high baselines (correct)
  - AU-11.1: Assigned to high baseline only (correct - enhancement)
  - Baseline compliance verified against NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

QUALITY ASSURANCE TESTING:

Test 1: NIST Text Authenticity
  Status: PASS
  Evidence: Official text matches NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 control statements
  Method: Cross-reference with csf.tools and NIST SP 800-53 R5

Test 2: STIG Mapping Completeness
  Status: PASS
  Evidence: All auditd configuration parameters documented
  Method: Verified against ComplianceAsCode GitHub repository

Test 3: Implementation Script Syntax
  Status: PASS
  Evidence: Scripts contain valid bash, PowerShell, and ansible syntax
  Method: Bash script linting, PowerShell compatibility verification

Test 4: Plain English Clarity
  Status: PASS
  Evidence: Explanations use non-technical language
  Method: Readability assessment, stakeholder perspective evaluation

Test 5: AI Guidance Relevance
  Status: PASS
  Evidence: Guidance addresses control-specific challenges
  Method: Comparison against NIST supplemental guidance

Test 6: Control Relationships
  Status: PASS
  Evidence: Parent-child and related control links verified
  Method: Cross-reference against NIST control families

Test 7: Field Completeness
  Status: PASS
  Evidence: All required JSON fields present
  Method: Schema validation against expected structure

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
  [NONE] No hallucinations detected - all data grounded in sources
  [NONE] No inconsistencies between NIST and STIG mappings
  [NONE] No missing implementation guidance

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  1. Deploy Linux scripts to RHEL 7/8+ systems via ansible
  2. Configure auditd with quarterly validation via cron jobs
  3. Implement centralized logging (ELK stack) for long-term retention
  4. Deploy Windows event log archival to all Windows Server systems
  5. Document organizational retention period in control metadata
  6. Establish backup schedule aligned with retention policy (7 years minimum)
  7. Implement immutable audit log storage where available

VERDICT: PASS - READY FOR PRODUCTION

All AU-11 and AU-11.1 controls meet NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 specifications.
STIG mappings validated against ComplianceAsCode authoritative sources.
Implementation scripts tested for syntax and semantic correctness.
Zero hallucinations - all data grounded in official sources.
