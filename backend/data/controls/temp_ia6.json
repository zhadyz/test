Ensure that authentication systems do not provide detailed error messages that could potentially expose sensitive information to unauthorized individuals.\n2. Limit the amount of feedback provided during the authentication process to only essential information necessary for the user to successfully authenticate.\n3. Regularly review and update authentication mechanisms to ensure that feedback is appropriately obscured and does not inadvertently disclose sensitive information.\n4. Train users and administrators on the importance of not sharing authentication feedback or sensitive information with unauthorized individuals.\n5. Conduct periodic audits and assessments to verify that authentication feedback is appropriately obscured and protected from exploitation by unauthorized individuals.",
