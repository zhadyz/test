Report and investigate incidents: Establish procedures for reporting insider threat incidents to the appropriate authorities, such as HR, legal, and law enforcement. Conduct thorough investigations to determine the cause of the incident and take appropriate disciplinary or legal action.\n\n7. Continuously improve the program: Regularly review and update the insider threat program to adapt to changing threats and technologies. Incorporate lessons learned from past incidents to enhance detection and response capabilities.\n\nBy following these steps, you can establish an effective insider threat program that helps protect your organization from internal security risks.",
