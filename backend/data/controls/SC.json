Begin by conducting a comprehensive inventory of all ports available on each system, including USB (all types), FireWire, Thunderbolt, eSATA, SD card slots, optical drives, and legacy parallel/serial ports. For each system category, determine which ports are operationally necessary and create an approved device whitelist. Linux systems can leverage udev rules to enforce USB device restrictions based on vendor ID, product ID, or device class. The USBGuard daemon provides enterprise-grade USB device authorization policy enforcement. Windows environments should use Group Policy to disable USB storage devices while allowing keyboards and mice. Consider BIOS/UEFI-level port disabling for maximum security on high-sensitivity systems. Document all exceptions with business justification and implement compensating controls such as endpoint DLP for approved removable media. Regularly audit port configurations and connected device logs to detect policy violations or unauthorized access attempts.",

For each classification, define which sensor types are prohibited (cameras, microphones, GPS, accelerometers, ambient light sensors). Develop procedures for device authorization that include security checks, sensor disabling verification, and accountability logs. Technical implementations may include mobile device management (MDM) solutions that can enforce camera/microphone disabling, RF shielding for highly sensitive areas, signal detection equipment to identify unauthorized transmissions, and physical device storage facilities outside restricted zones. For software-based sensors in enterprise applications, implement application-level permissions controls and audit logging for sensor access.

For each identified component, develop specific usage guidelines addressing who may use the component (role-based authorization), under what circumstances use is permitted, what data may be accessed or processed, logging and monitoring requirements, and periodic access review schedules. Implement technical controls including application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized tool installation, privileged access management (PAM) solutions for tool authorization, comprehensive audit logging of tool usage, just-in-time access provisioning for sensitive tools, and network segmentation to limit tool reach. Establish monitoring dashboards to detect anomalous tool usage patterns that may indicate compromise or misuse. Conduct regular reviews of component usage logs and authorization lists.",

Organizations can choose between commercial sandbox solutions (FireEye, Palo Alto WildFire, Cisco Threat Grid, Joe Sandbox) or open-source options (Cuckoo Sandbox, CAPE Sandbox, Any.Run). Key implementation considerations include network isolation ensuring the sandbox cannot reach production systems except through controlled channels, realistic environment configuration with common software (Office, Adobe, browsers) to trigger malware behaviors, anti-evasion measures as sophisticated malware detects virtualization and alters behavior, automated submission pipelines integrating email gateways and web proxies to automatically submit suspicious content, comprehensive logging capturing network traffic, file system changes, registry modifications, process activity, and API calls, indicator extraction automatically extracting IOCs (hashes, domains, IPs, mutex names) for threat intelligence, and retention policies for preserving analysis artifacts for incident response and threat hunting. For infrastructure, consider dedicated analysis networks with appropriate air-gapping, VLAN segmentation, or software-defined isolation.

    "ai_guidance": "Implementing SC-45 System Time Synchronization requires configuring reliable NTP infrastructure across the enterprise. For authoritative time sources, prefer GPS-synchronized stratum 1 servers or connect to NIST (time.nist.gov) or authenticated NTP pools. Linux systems should use chronyd (preferred on RHEL/CentOS 8+) or ntpd, configured with multiple upstream servers for redundancy. Key configuration includes setting appropriate polling intervals (typically 64-1024 seconds), enabling iburst for fast initial synchronization, configuring maxpoll and minpoll appropriately for your network, implementing authentication using NTP symmetric keys or NTS (Network Time Security) for chrony, and restricting NTP server access to prevent amplification attacks. Windows systems should configure the Windows Time Service (W32Time) to use domain controllers as time sources (domain members) or external NTP servers (standalone systems). For domain controllers, the PDC emulator should sync with an external authoritative source. Monitor time offset and ensure all systems maintain offset within acceptable tolerances (typically less than 1 second for general use, sub-millisecond for high-frequency trading or precise audit correlation). Implement alerting when systems drift beyond acceptable thresholds. Document approved time sources and synchronization topology.",

Authoritative time sources should be stratum 1 or 2 servers with documented accuracy (GPS-synchronized NIST servers provide sub-millisecond accuracy).

For geographic diversity, if your primary source is in the Eastern US (e.g., time.nist.gov in Maryland), configure secondary sources in Western US (time-b-wwv.nist.gov in Colorado) or internationally. NTP client configuration handles failover automatically - chrony and ntpd query multiple servers and use the best available source. Configure at least 4 time sources for optimal operation (NTP algorithms work best with 4+ sources for Byzantine fault tolerance). Use the 'prefer' directive to designate the primary source while allowing automatic failover. Monitor time source availability and alert when sources become unreachable. Document primary and secondary time sources with their geographic locations. Consider diversity not just in geography but also in network paths (different ISPs, different DNS providers). For critical infrastructure, consider deploying local stratum 2 servers that sync with geographically diverse stratum 1 sources, providing local redundancy while maintaining authoritative accuracy.",
