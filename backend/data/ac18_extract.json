Implement a policy that prohibits the use of unauthorized wireless access points within the organization.\n2. Regularly scan the premises for unauthorized wireless networks and take immediate action to disable them.\n3. Ensure that all authorized wireless access points are securely configured with strong encryption and authentication mechanisms.\n4. Enforce the use of strong passwords for accessing wireless networks and regularly update these passwords.\n5. Educate employees on the risks associated with connecting to unsecured wireless networks and the importance of following the organization's wireless access policies.\n6. Monitor network traffic for any suspicious activity related to wireless access and investigate any anomalies promptly.\n7.
