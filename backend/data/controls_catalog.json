Examples of system account types include individual, shared, group, system, guest, anonymous, emergency, developer, temporary, and service accounts.\n\nOrganizations identify authorized system users and the types of accounts allowed and prohibited. Access privileges and account attributes reflect requirements from other security and privacy controls. Administrative accounts require heightened scrutiny during approval due to their elevated privileges.\n\nAccount types prohibited due to increased risk include: shared, group, emergency, anonymous, temporary, and guest accounts. Where access involves personally identifiable information (PII), security programs collaborate with privacy officials to establish appropriate controls.\n\nTemporary and emergency accounts are short-term by design. Temporary accounts support planned short-term needs without immediacy demands. Emergency accounts respond to crisis situations requiring rapid activation, potentially bypassing normal authorization processes. Both account types must include automatic expiration to prevent persistent unauthorized access.\n\nAccount management processes align with personnel security controls (PS-4 Personnel Termination, PS-5 Personnel Transfer) to ensure timely account status updates when employment relationships change.",
    "ai_guidance": "Account Management is about controlling who can access your systems. Think of it like managing keys to a building:\n\n1. Keep a master list of everyone with an account\n2. Different types of accounts for different purposes (employee, contractor, emergency, temporary)\n3. Require approval before creating new accounts\n4. Remove access immediately when someone leaves\n5. Regularly check that all accounts are still needed\n6. Avoid shared accounts - everyone should have their own login\n7. Monitor for suspicious account activity\n8. Automatically disable accounts that haven't been used in 90 days\n9. Log every time an account is created, modified, or deleted\n10. Force logout after 15 minutes of inactivity\n\nThe goal: ensure only authorized people have access, and only for as long as they need it."

Examples include when individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible federal information systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles are received. Organizations may also decide to bypass identification or authentication via software-readable physical switch that commands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental or unmonitored use. This control addresses situations where identification and authentication have not yet occurred and is not intended to apply to situations where identification and authentication have already occurred and are subsequently bypassed.

Mobile device functionality may include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors for capturing information, and built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smartphones, tablets, and e-readers. Protection and control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based, requiring users to take physical action to protect devices when outside controlled areas. Usage restrictions and implementation guidance for mobile devices include: configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall), scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared). Organizations should recognize that adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements in this control. Many safeguards and countermeasures for mobile devices are reflected in other security controls. AC-20 addresses mobile devices that are not organization-controlled.",

Lower-value systems may have less restrictive policies, while critical systems enforce strict portable storage controls.",

High-value systems (financial database servers, HR systems with PII, classified systems): Implement strict USBGuard whitelisting, block all portable storage except explicitly approved devices. Moderate-value systems (general workstations): Allow registered organizational portable storage, block unknown devices. Low-value systems (training labs, public kiosks): Monitor-only mode with audit logging but no blocking. This risk-based approach focuses strongest controls on systems with highest data sensitivity.",

Classify organizational systems by value/sensitivity: High (critical infrastructure, financial systems, PII databases), Moderate (general workstations, department servers), Low (training systems, public kiosks).\n2. Define portable storage restrictions per classification: High systems prohibit all unregistered portable storage, Moderate systems allow organizational devices only, Low systems monitor but allow with warnings.\n3. Implement technical controls appropriate to each classification tier.\n4. Document system classifications and corresponding portable storage policies.\n5. Train system administrators on classification criteria and enforcement.\n6. Periodically review system classifications (as data sensitivity changes).\n7. Audit compliance with classification-based restrictions.\n8. Establish exception process for legitimate business needs on High-value systems.",

High-value systems (financial, classified, personally identifiable information) should have the strictest controls. Moderate-value systems may allow organizational portable storage with monitoring. Low-value systems (development, training) may use monitoring-only approaches. Organizations define system classifications and corresponding restrictions. Implementation typically involves USB device whitelisting on critical systems via USBGuard (Linux) or Group Policy (Windows), while less critical systems use audit-only modes with centralized logging and alerting.",

AC-19(5) is REQUIRED for Moderate and High baseline systems per NIST SP 800-53. Encryption must use FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules and strong algorithms (AES-256).

Protect bootloader configuration to prevent adversaries from disabling the reference monitor via kernel parameters.\n\n3. **Verify Always Invoked Property**: Confirm every access decision passes through the MAC system by reviewing audit logs and testing policy enforcement. No subjects should operate in unconfined domains unless explicitly required and documented.\n\n4. **Verify Verifiable Property**: Use well-established MAC policies (e.g., SELinux targeted policy) that have undergone extensive security analysis. Document the policy architecture and conduct periodic reviews.\n\n5. **Monitor and Audit**: Configure audit rules to detect any modifications to MAC policies, ensuring the integrity of the reference monitor is maintained.\n\n6. **Organizational Policy Definition**: Define which access control policies the reference monitor will enforce (e.g., role-based access control, multi-level security, data flow control).\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: Regularly test the reference monitor implementation to verify it correctly enforces policies under all conditions, including edge cases and adversarial scenarios.\n\n8. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of the reference monitor architecture, policies enforced, and verification procedures for audit and compliance purposes.",

    "supplemental_guidance": "The reference monitor concept, as defined in the Anderson Report (1972), is a fundamental principle of secure system design. It operates as an abstract machine that mediates all access decisions between subjects and objects according to a security policy.\n\nThe three essential properties ensure:\n- **Tamperproof**: Prevents adversaries from modifying the validation mechanism to bypass security policies. Typically achieved through kernel-level implementation with hardware protection.\n- **Always Invoked**: Prevents time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) attacks and ensures no covert channels exist to bypass the monitor. Every access path must be mediated.\n- **Verifiable**: Enables formal or rigorous analysis to prove the monitor correctly implements the security policy. Complexity is the enemy of security; smaller implementations are more analyzable.\n\nIn modern systems, Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) and AppArmor represent practical implementations of the reference monitor concept through kernel-level mandatory access control. These systems enforce type enforcement, role-based access control, and multi-level security policies that supplement traditional discretionary access control.\n\nOrganizations must define which access control policies the reference monitor enforces based on their security requirements. Common policies include: mandatory access control (MAC), role-based access control (RBAC), multi-level security (MLS), and information flow control.\n\nRelated architectural controls include SC-3 (Security Function Isolation) which ensures the reference monitor is isolated from other system components, and SA-8 (Security and Privacy Engineering Principles) which addresses secure design from inception.",

This site should have the necessary infrastructure, resources, and capabilities to continue critical operations in a timely manner. \n\nTo implement this control effectively, you should:\n1. Identify and designate an alternate processing site that is geographically separate from the primary site to reduce the risk of simultaneous disruption.\n2. Ensure that the alternate site is equipped with the necessary hardware, software, data, and personnel to support critical functions.\n3. Develop and regularly test a continuity of operations plan (COOP) that outlines the procedures for transitioning operations to the alternate site.\n4. Train personnel on their roles and responsibilities during a transition to the alternate site.\n5. Conduct regular drills and exercises to ensure that the alternate site can effectively take over operations in case of an emergency.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that your organization is prepared to maintain essential functions even in the event of a disruption at the primary processing site.",

Identify the identity providers and authorization servers that are suitable for your organization's needs.\n2. Integrate these systems with your existing infrastructure to ensure seamless authentication and authorization processes.\n3. Configure the identity providers and authorization servers to enforce access controls based on user roles, attributes, and policies.\n4. Regularly review and update the configurations to ensure they align with your organization's security requirements and compliance standards.\n5. Train your employees on how to use the identity providers and authorization servers effectively to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n6. Conduct regular audits and assessments to verify that the identity providers and authorization servers are functioning as intended and are compliant with relevant regulations.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively implement identity providers and authorization servers to meet the requirements of control IA-13.",

This includes implementing privacy controls, minimizing data collection, and ensuring data protection measures are in place.\n\n2. Least Privilege: Limit access to system resources to only those necessary for users to perform their job functions. This principle helps reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.\n\n3. Defense-in-Depth: Implement multiple layers of security controls to protect systems and data. This includes network segmentation, encryption, intrusion detection systems, and regular security monitoring.\n\n4. Secure Development Practices: Follow secure coding practices and conduct regular security testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in software applications.\n\n5. Resilience and Redundancy: Design systems with resilience and redundancy in mind to ensure continuity of operations in the event of a cyber incident or disaster.\n\nBy incorporating these principles into the system development process, organizations can enhance the security and privacy posture of their systems and better protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure.",

Implement strict access controls and user permissions to limit the number of individuals who can make changes to the system.\n4. Conduct regular audits and monitoring of system logs to detect any unauthorized changes or tampering attempts.\n5.
